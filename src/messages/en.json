It follows that an official document is considered conclusive proof, and the person relying on it is not required to prove its validity, and it cannot be challenged except by a claim of forgery in accordance with the prescribed statutory procedures."

The system of evidence has regulated its validity in the text of Article Twenty-Nine, which stipulated that the ordinary document is evidence against the one who signed it, unless he explicitly denies what is attributed to him in terms of handwriting, signature, seal or fingerprint. If the signature is proven, the signatory is bound by everything contained in the document, and it is not accepted from him thereafter to claim lack of understanding, haste or ignorance of its content. And whoever is challenged with an ordinary document and discusses its subject before the court, it is not accepted from him to deny its validity thereafter."

Hence, the real difference between an official document and an ordinary document does not appear at the moment of signing, but rather becomes clearly evident when the dispute arises and the parties appear before the court, where the evidentiary power of each document and its effect in proving or disproving rights is determined."
